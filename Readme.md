## Using React

If you want to use React for the frontend, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Vite using npm:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

2. Provide the project name (e.g., "ABC"), choose React as the framework, and select JavaScript as the variant.

3. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ABC
   ```

4. Optionally, you can install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Once the server is running, you can open your web browser and access the development environment.
